# Firstborn

The first website I attempted to make, it helped me find out what to and not-to do. I had just learned CSS and HTML when I 
put it togeather so I was experimenting and testing to see if certain things were possible, I later re-visited it when I learned
some basic JavaScript to make the Forums section functional ( I hadn't learned nearly enough at the time ) it took me forever to 
get it working but hey, what better way to grasp how something works than through trial an error. For that reason the CSS may be
 just a little gritty.
